                    <h4>Pashely Book</h4><p>This picture is a page from my catalog I did for Pashley bicicles. They are a English bike/apparel company. For the design, I leaned towards more of a high class sort of style, almost along the lines of a fashon catalog.</p>

                        <h4>Overlord Movie Website</h4>
                        <p>A promotional movie website for the film Overlord that came out in 2018. The film was a action thriller with horror elements. For the design, I went with a darker theme to match the tone of the movie and used multiple scenes for background material.</p>

                        <h4>Custom Alphabet</h4><p>These are custom letters I designed for a type book. The type book revolved around positive and negative which is why the leter alternate between having black or blue as the main color. The "positive" words/letter have a more solid design compared to the "negative" words/letters which have a broken/unstable appearence.</p>

                        <h4>PSA Sticker</h4><p>This sticker was design to spread awareness of physical/mental abuse victims. It was designed around a fictional organization called "TALK" where their logo/icon is this characterized child. </p>

                        <h4>Doom War Book Cover</h4><p>This book cover was design for the Marvel comic series "Doom War." Doom War revolves around the supervillian "Dr. Doom" which is also the main silhouette on the right/cover side. To represent how the story revolves around him, I designed him so that scenes from the comics would make up his silhouette</p>

                        <h4>Fictional VCD Website</h4><p>This website was desiged for the EWU VCD department. I wanted to more with a more editorial style of design for the website. I also wanted to include heavy use of images witin the design because I believe it would be fitting for a design major. The images would be used to show student works as well as events specific to the design department.</p>
